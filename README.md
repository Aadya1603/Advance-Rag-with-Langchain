# Advance-Rag-with-Langchain

Welcome to the Advance-Rag-with-Langchain repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of advanced techniques in building chatbots using LangChain, a powerful framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs).

## Overview

This repository showcases three distinct chatbot implementations, each leveraging a unique approach and set of tools:

1. **Agents Chatbot**: Utilizing the concept of agents, this chatbot demonstrates the power of decomposing complex tasks into subtasks, delegating them to specialized agents, and synthesizing the results into a coherent response.

2. **Local LaMa Chatbot**: Leveraging the Local LaMa (Language Model Analysis) technique, this chatbot showcases the ability to ground conversations in relevant local data sources, enabling context-aware and data-driven responses.

3. **Groq Chatbot**: GROQ can describe exactly what information your application needs, join information from several sets of documents, and stitch together a very specific response with only the exact fields you need.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advance-Rag-with-Langchain.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the different chatbot implementations in the respective directories: `agents/`, `chatbot/`, and `groq/`.
4. Run the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks to interact with the chatbots and experiment with different configurations and use cases.
